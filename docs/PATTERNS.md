## Implemented Patterns (v1.0)

### 1. Supervisor Pattern

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (v1.0)

**Also Known As**: Manager Pattern, Hub-and-Spoke, Coordinator Pattern

**Problem It Solves**:
Centralized control over multiple specialized agents for complex tasks requiring delegation, routing, and aggregation.

**When to Use**:
- Customer service systems with specialized agents (billing, technical, sales)
- Research tasks requiring multiple expert agents
- Content generation pipelines with editor oversight
- Any workflow where a central coordinator delegates to specialists

**How It Works**:
1. Central supervisor receives user requests
2. Routes tasks to specialized agents using LLM-based or rule-based routing
3. Aggregates responses from agents
4. Returns synthesized result to user

**Communication Model**:
- Hub-and-spoke topology
- Only supervisor communicates with user
- Agents report back to supervisor
- Supervisor maintains conversation state

**Use Cases**:
- **Customer Support**: Route to billing, tech support, or sales agents
- **Research Assistant**: Delegate to web search, data analysis, and report writing agents
- **Content Creation**: Editor supervisor coordinates writer, fact-checker, and formatter agents

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: supervisor
  config:
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    max_rounds: 10
    routing_strategy: best_match  # or round_robin, manual
  agents:
    - billing-agent
    - tech-support-agent
    - sales-agent

agents:
  - name: billing-agent
    role: react
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    prompt: |
      You are a billing specialist. Help users with payment issues.

  - name: tech-support-agent
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    prompt: |
      You are a technical support expert. Troubleshoot user issues.
```

**Code Example**:
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/supervisor"

supervisor := supervisor.New(supervisor.SupervisorDef{
    Name:            "coordinator",
    Model:           "gpt-4-turbo",
    MaxRounds:       10,
    RoutingStrategy: supervisor.StrategyBestMatch,
}, agents, runtime)

result, _ := supervisor.Run(ctx, "I need help with my bill")
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Routing decisions per agent
- Round count per task
- Agent utilization
- Task completion rate

**Real-World Usage**:
- Used in production by customer service platforms
- Standard pattern in LangGraph and CrewAI
- Microsoft AutoGen's default orchestration mode

---

### 2. Sequential Pattern

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (v1.0)

**Also Known As**: Chain Pattern, Pipeline Pattern, Step-based Execution

**Problem It Solves**:
Tasks requiring ordered execution where each step's output feeds the next step's input.

**When to Use**:
- Document processing pipelines (extract → transform → validate → store)
- Multi-stage content generation (research → draft → edit → publish)
- Data processing workflows with dependencies
- Any task where steps must execute in order

**How It Works**:
1. Define ordered sequence of steps
2. Execute step 1 with initial input
3. Pass step 1 output to step 2
4. Continue until all steps complete
5. Return final step output

**Communication Model**:
- Linear data flow from step N to step N+1
- State persisted between steps (with checkpointing)
- Each step receives previous step's output as input

**Use Cases**:
- **Content Pipeline**: Research → Write → Edit → Format → Publish
- **Data Processing**: Extract → Clean → Transform → Validate → Load (ETL)
- **Document Analysis**: Parse → Extract Entities → Classify → Summarize

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: sequential
  agents:
    - research-agent
    - writer-agent
    - editor-agent
    - publisher-agent

agents:
  - name: research-agent
    role: react
    prompt: |
      Research the topic and gather relevant information.

  - name: writer-agent
    role: react
    prompt: |
      Write a draft article based on the research provided.

  - name: editor-agent
    role: react
    prompt: |
      Edit the draft for clarity, grammar, and style.
```

**Code Example**:
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/workflow"

workflow := workflow.NewWorkflow("content-pipeline")
workflow.AddStep("research", researchHandler)
workflow.AddStep("write", writeHandler)
workflow.AddStep("edit", editHandler)

executor := workflow.NewExecutor(workflow)
result, _ := executor.Execute(ctx, "Write about AI agents")
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Per-step latency
- Pipeline success rate
- Checkpoint frequency
- Token usage per step

**Real-World Usage**:
- LangGraph's default chaining pattern
- Used in every ETL/ELT pipeline
- Content management systems

## Planned Patterns (v2.0)

### 3. Parallel Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 3)

**Also Known As**: Fan-out-Fan-in, Map-Reduce, Scatter-Gather, Concurrent Execution

**Problem It Solves**:
Independent sub-tasks that can be processed simultaneously to reduce total execution time.

**When to Use**:
- Multi-source research (query multiple databases in parallel)
- A/B testing different approaches simultaneously
- Batch processing of independent items
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Any task where sub-tasks don't depend on each other

**How It Works**:
1. Fan out: Send same input to N agents concurrently
2. Execute: All agents process in parallel (goroutines)
3. Wait: Barrier synchronization until all complete
4. Fan in: Aggregate results from all agents
5. Return: Synthesized result

**Communication Model**:
- Broadcast input to all agents
- Parallel execution (no shared state during execution)
- Barrier synchronization for completion
- Result aggregation with conflict resolution

**Use Cases**:
- **Market Analysis**: Simultaneously analyze competitors, market size, regulations, and tech trends
- **Multi-Database Search**: Query PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB in parallel
- **Ensemble Predictions**: Get predictions from multiple models concurrently
- **Code Review**: Run linter, security scanner, and tests in parallel

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: parallel
  config:
    timeout: 60s
    aggregation: voting  # or merge, concat
  agents:
    - competitive-analysis
    - market-sizing
    - regulatory-analysis
    - tech-trends

agents:
  - name: competitive-analysis
    role: react
    prompt: |
      Analyze competitors in this market.

  - name: market-sizing
    role: react
    prompt: |
      Estimate the total addressable market.
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

parallel := orchestration.NewParallel(
    "market-analysis",
    runtime,
    []string{"competitive-analysis", "market-sizing", "regulatory-analysis", "tech-trends"},
    orchestration.WithAggregator("voting-aggregator"),
)

result, _ := parallel.Execute(ctx, inputMsg)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Agents succeeded vs failed
- Wait time (max agent latency, not sum)
- Goroutines spawned
- Cost aggregation across agents

**Performance**:
- **Speedup**: 3-4× for 4 independent agents
- **Cost**: N× (runs N agents)
- **Latency**: max(agent_latencies), not sum(agent_latencies)

**Real-World Usage**:
- LangGraph's map-reduce pattern
- Google ADK parallel agents
- Used extensively in data pipelines

---

### 4. Router Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 3)

**Also Known As**: Intent Router, Semantic Router, Query Classifier, Dispatcher

**Problem It Solves**:
Efficiently routing requests to the most appropriate specialized agent or model based on input characteristics, optimizing for cost, latency, and quality.

**When to Use**:
- Cost optimization (route simple queries to cheap models, complex to expensive)
- Specialized agent selection based on query type
- Intent-based conversation routing
- Safety routing (sensitive content to specialized handlers)
- Load balancing across agent pools

**How It Works**:
1. Classify/score input using classifier agent or embedding similarity
2. Select best-match agent based on classification
3. Route request to selected agent
4. Return agent's response
5. Track routing accuracy for optimization

**Communication Model**:
- Two-stage: classify → route
- Classifier is lightweight (fast classification)
- Selected agent handles actual task
- Fallback agent if classification uncertain

**Use Cases**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Simple questions → GPT-3.5, complex → GPT-4 (85% cost reduction)
- **Customer Service**: Technical → tech agent, billing → billing agent, general → general agent
- **Model Selection**: Math → specialized math model, code → code model, general → general model
- **Language Routing**: Detect language, route to language-specific agent

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: router
  config:
    classifier: intent-classifier
    fallback: general-agent  # If classification fails
    routes:
      technical: tech-support-agent
      billing: billing-agent
      sales: sales-agent

agents:
  - name: intent-classifier
    role: classifier
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo  # Fast, cheap classification
    categories:
      - technical
      - billing
      - sales

  - name: tech-support-agent
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo  # Expensive, only for tech queries
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

router := orchestration.NewRouter(
    "customer-service-router",
    runtime,
    "intent-classifier",
    map[string]string{
        "technical": "tech-support-agent",
        "billing":   "billing-agent",
        "sales":     "sales-agent",
    },
    orchestration.WithFallback("general-agent"),
)

result, _ := router.Execute(ctx, userQuery)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Routing accuracy (% correct routes)
- Route confidence scores
- Fallback rate
- Cost savings vs baseline (always using expensive model)
- Latency per route

**Performance**:
- **Cost Savings**: 25-50% reduction vs always using best model
- **Latency**: Classification adds ~50-100ms
- **Accuracy**: Depends on classifier quality (90-95% typical)

**Real-World Usage**:
- RouteLLM framework for model routing
- LangGraph's semantic router
- Used by every major AI platform for cost optimization

### 5. Swarm Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 3)

**Also Known As**: Peer-to-Peer, Decentralized Handoff, Agent Mesh, Dynamic Routing

**Problem It Solves**:
Dynamic, decentralized agent collaboration where any agent can hand off to any other agent based on conversational context, without a central coordinator.

**When to Use**:
- Customer service with seamless specialist handoffs
- Complex troubleshooting requiring multiple experts
- Adaptive conversation routing based on topic shifts
- Collaborative problem-solving across agent types

**How It Works**:
1. Each agent aware of all other agents in the swarm
2. Agent processes message and decides: handle it OR transfer to another agent
3. Handoff via `transfer_to_XXX` function calls
4. Conversation state preserved across handoffs
5. Continue until task complete or max handoffs reached

**Communication Model**:
- Mesh topology (any agent can talk to any agent)
- Handoff-based routing (agent-driven, not supervisor-driven)
- Shared conversation history across agents
- Conversational flow or predefined rules guide transitions

**Use Cases**:
- **Customer Support**: General → Billing (payment issue detected) → Technical (refund requires technical check) → General (resolution)
- **Debugging**: Code Agent → System Agent (OS issue found) → Network Agent (network problem) → Code Agent (fix applied)
- **Healthcare**: Triage Agent → Specialist Agent → Diagnostic Agent → Treatment Agent

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: swarm
  config:
    max_handoffs: 10  # Prevent infinite loops
    shared_state: conversation  # All agents see conversation history
  agents:
    - general-agent
    - billing-agent
    - tech-agent

agents:
  - name: general-agent
    role: react
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    transfers:
      - billing-agent
      - tech-agent
    prompt: |
      You are a general support agent. Transfer to billing-agent for payment issues,
      or tech-agent for technical problems.

  - name: billing-agent
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    transfers:
      - general-agent
      - tech-agent
    prompt: |
      You are a billing specialist. Transfer to tech-agent if technical issue found.
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

swarm := orchestration.NewSwarm(
    "customer-service-swarm",
    runtime,
    map[string][]string{
        "general-agent":  {"billing-agent", "tech-agent"},
        "billing-agent":  {"general-agent", "tech-agent"},
        "tech-agent":     {"general-agent", "billing-agent"},
    },
    orchestration.WithMaxHandoffs(10),
)

result, _ := swarm.Execute(ctx, userMessage)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Handoff count per conversation
- Handoff path (agent → agent → agent)
- Average handoffs to resolution
- Dead-end rate (agent can't help, no transfer)

**Performance**:
- **Flexibility**: High (agents adapt to conversation)
- **Latency**: Increases with handoffs
- **Cost**: Variable (depends on handoffs)

**Real-World Usage**:
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Reference implementation of this pattern
- Used in customer service platforms
- Growing adoption in 2024-2025

### 6. Hierarchical Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 4)

**Also Known As**: Delegator Pattern, Layered Management, Multi-Level Orchestration

**Problem It Solves**:
Complex tasks requiring multi-level decomposition where a manager delegates to sub-managers who further delegate to workers.

**When to Use**:
- Enterprise task automation with approval chains
- Large-scale research with domain-specific sub-teams
- Complex project management with work breakdown structures
- Organizational hierarchies mapped to agent hierarchies

**How It Works**:
1. Top-level manager receives task
2. Decomposes task into sub-tasks
3. Delegates sub-tasks to sub-managers
4. Sub-managers further delegate to workers
5. Results bubble up through hierarchy
6. Top manager synthesizes final result

**Communication Model**:
- Tree topology (manager → sub-managers → workers)
- Top-down delegation
- Bottom-up result aggregation
- Manager at each level validates and coordinates

**Use Cases**:
- **Software Project**: Project Manager → (Frontend Lead, Backend Lead, QA Lead) → Individual Engineers
- **Research Project**: Lead Researcher → (Data Team, Analysis Team, Writing Team) → Individual Researchers
- **Enterprise Workflow**: CEO → VPs → Directors → Managers → Workers

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: hierarchical
  config:
    manager: project-manager
    teams:
      frontend:
        manager: frontend-lead
        workers: [ui-engineer, ux-engineer]
      backend:
        manager: backend-lead
        workers: [api-engineer, db-engineer]
      qa:
        manager: qa-lead
        workers: [test-engineer, automation-engineer]
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

hierarchical := orchestration.NewHierarchical(
    "project-hierarchy",
    runtime,
    "project-manager",
    map[string]orchestration.Team{
        "frontend": {
            Manager: "frontend-lead",
            Workers: []string{"ui-engineer", "ux-engineer"},
        },
        "backend": {
            Manager: "backend-lead",
            Workers: []string{"api-engineer", "db-engineer"},
        },
    },
)

result, _ := hierarchical.Execute(ctx, projectSpec)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Hierarchy depth
- Delegation count per level
- Bottleneck managers (high delegation, slow response)
- Cross-team communication

**Performance**:
- **Scalability**: High (divide-and-conquer)
- **Latency**: Increases with hierarchy depth
- **Cost**: Scales with team size

**Real-World Usage**:
- CrewAI's hierarchical process
- Used in enterprise workflow automation
- Management simulation systems

### 7. RAG Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 3)

**Also Known As**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Knowledge-Grounded Generation

**Problem It Solves**:
Agent retrieves relevant information from knowledge base before generating response, enabling access to current/private data beyond LLM training cutoff.

**When to Use**:
- Enterprise chatbots (need access to company docs)
- Documentation assistants
- Question answering over large document sets
- Any system needing current or private information

**How It Works**:
1. Embed user query
2. Retrieve relevant documents from vector store (top-K)
3. Rerank results for relevance (optional)
4. Pass retrieved context + query to LLM
5. LLM generates grounded answer
6. Return answer with citations

**Communication Model**:
- Sequential: retrieve → generate
- Vector store as knowledge backend
- LLM has no direct access to knowledge (only via retrieval)

**Use Cases**:
- **Customer Support**: Retrieve KB articles, then generate answer
- **Legal Research**: Retrieve case law, then synthesize analysis
- **Enterprise Search**: Retrieve docs, then summarize
- **Code Documentation**: Retrieve code, then explain

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: rag
  config:
    retriever: vector-retriever
    generator: answer-generator
    top_k: 5
    rerank: true

agents:
  - name: vector-retriever
    role: retriever
    vector_store: qdrant
    collection: company-docs
    embedding_model: text-embedding-3-large

  - name: answer-generator
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    prompt: |
      Answer the question based ONLY on the provided context.
      If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't know".

      Context:
      {context}

      Question: {question}
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

rag := orchestration.NewRAG(
    "enterprise-qa",
    runtime,
    "vector-retriever",
    "answer-generator",
    orchestration.WithTopK(5),
    orchestration.WithRerank(true),
)

result, _ := rag.Execute(ctx, userQuestion)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Retrieval precision/recall
- Context usage (% of retrieved context used in answer)
- Hallucination rate (answer not grounded in context)
- Cache hit rate
- Latency breakdown (retrieval vs generation)

**Performance**:
- **Cost**: 70% token reduction vs stuffing entire KB in prompt
- **Latency**: Retrieval ~100ms, generation ~1-3s
- **Accuracy**: Depends on retrieval quality

**Real-World Usage**:
- **Most common pattern** in enterprise AI
- Every chatbot uses this
- LangChain's original use case

Improving output quality through iterative self-assessment and refinement loops, reducing errors and improving reasoning.

**When to Use**:
- Code generation with self-review
- Content creation with quality checks
- Complex reasoning with verification
- Safety-critical outputs requiring validation

**How It Works**:
1. Generator produces initial output
2. Critic evaluates output and provides feedback
3. Generator refines output based on feedback
4. Loop continues until quality threshold met or max iterations reached
5. Return final refined output

**Communication Model**:
- Iterative loop between generator and critic
- Critic provides structured feedback
- Generator uses feedback to improve
- Convergence criteria or max iterations

**Use Cases**:
- **Code Generation**: Write code → Review for bugs → Fix bugs → Review again → Deploy
- **Writing**: Draft → Critique style/clarity → Revise → Critique grammar → Final
- **Math**: Solve problem → Verify solution → Correct errors → Verify again
- **Translation**: Translate → Check fluency → Refine → Check accuracy

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: reflection
  config:
    generator: code-generator
    critic: code-reviewer
    max_iterations: 3
    quality_threshold: 0.9

agents:
  - name: code-generator
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    prompt: |
      Write Python code to solve the problem.

  - name: code-reviewer
    role: react
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    prompt: |
      Review the code for bugs, style issues, and improvements.
      Rate quality 0-1. Provide specific feedback.
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

reflection := orchestration.NewReflection(
    "code-refinement",
    runtime,
    "code-generator",
    "code-reviewer",
    orchestration.WithMaxIterations(3),
    orchestration.WithQualityThreshold(0.9),
)

result, _ := reflection.Execute(ctx, problemDescription)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Rounds to convergence
- Quality improvement per round
- Termination reason (converged vs max rounds)
- Token usage per iteration

**Performance**:
- **Cost**: 2-4× base cost (initial + critique + 1-2 refinements)
- **Quality**: 20-50% improvement over single-shot
- **Latency**: 2-4× base latency

**Real-World Usage**:
- LangChain's reflection agents
- Used in code generation (Cursor, Copilot)
- Academic research (Reflexion paper)

---

### 9. Ensemble Pattern

**Status**: 🚧 Planned (Phase 4)

**Also Known As**: Voting, Multi-Model Aggregation, Model Ensemble

**Problem It Solves**:
Multiple models vote on outputs to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations, especially for high-stakes decisions.

**When to Use**:
- Medical diagnosis (high accuracy required)
- Financial forecasting (reduce risk)
- Content moderation (reduce false positives/negatives)
- Any high-stakes decision where accuracy > cost

**How It Works**:
1. Send same input to N models/agents in parallel
2. Collect all predictions
3. Aggregate using voting strategy:
   - Majority voting
   - Weighted voting (by model confidence)
   - Unanimous (all must agree)
4. Return consensus prediction

**Communication Model**:
- Parallel execution (all models run concurrently)
- Independent predictions (no coordination)
- Aggregation after all complete
- Voting or confidence-weighted aggregation

**Use Cases**:
- **Medical**: 3 diagnostic models vote on diagnosis
- **Finance**: 5 models vote on stock recommendation
- **Content Moderation**: 3 models vote on flagging decision
- **E-commerce**: Multiple models extract product attributes, vote on category

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
orchestration:
  pattern: ensemble
  config:
    voting_strategy: majority  # or weighted, unanimous
    models:
      - gpt-4-turbo
      - claude-3-5-sonnet
      - gemini-1.5-pro
    threshold: 0.6  # 60% must agree

agents:
  - name: gpt4-classifier
    role: classifier
    model: gpt-4-turbo

  - name: claude-classifier
    role: classifier
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet

  - name: gemini-classifier
    role: classifier
    model: gemini-1.5-pro
```

**Code Example** (v2.0):
```go
import "github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/internal/orchestration"

ensemble := orchestration.NewEnsemble(
    "medical-diagnosis",
    runtime,
    []string{"gpt4-diagnostic", "claude-diagnostic", "gemini-diagnostic"},
    orchestration.WithVotingStrategy(orchestration.VotingMajority),
    orchestration.WithThreshold(0.6),
)

result, _ := ensemble.Execute(ctx, symptoms)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Agreement rate (unanimous vs split)
- Vote distribution
- Confidence per model
- Fallback rate (disagreement)

**Performance**:
- **Cost**: 3-5× base cost (run 3-5 models)
- **Accuracy**: 25-50% error reduction
- **Latency**: max(model_latencies) with parallel execution

**Real-World Usage**:
- Medical AI systems
- Financial trading algorithms
- E-commerce (LLM-Ensemble paper)

## Future Patterns (v2.1+)

### 10. Debate Pattern

**Status**: 🔮 Future (v2.1+)

**Also Known As**: Multi-Agent Debate, Adversarial Collaboration, Structured Dissent

**Problem It Solves**:
Multiple agents with different perspectives debate decisions before reaching consensus, improving factual accuracy and reasoning through adversarial collaboration.

**When to Use**:
- Complex decisions requiring diverse perspectives
- Factual accuracy critical (debate reduces hallucinations)
- Research synthesis needing critical analysis
- High-stakes decisions benefiting from dissent

**How It Works**:
1. Assign perspectives to agents (believer, skeptic, neutral)
2. Each agent presents argument
3. Agents critique each other's arguments (multiple rounds)
4. Consensus emerges or vote after max rounds
5. Return synthesized decision

**Use Cases**:
- Healthcare decision support (multiple diagnostic viewpoints)
- Legal analysis (prosecution vs defense perspectives)
- Financial risk assessment (bull vs bear perspectives)
- Research synthesis (critical review of findings)

**Performance**:
- **Cost**: 9× base cost (3 agents × 3 rounds)
- **Accuracy**: Improves factual accuracy by 20-40%
- **Latency**: Serial execution (slow)

### 11. Plan-and-Execute Pattern

**Status**: 🔮 Future (v2.1+, possibly Phase 2)

**Also Known As**: Planner-Executor, Decompose-Execute, Strategic Planner

**Problem It Solves**:
Complex tasks requiring upfront planning before execution, with potential re-planning based on results.

**When to Use**:
- Multi-step research projects
- Complex data analysis workflows
- Software development tasks
- Any task benefiting from strategic planning

**How It Works**:
1. Planner decomposes goal into sub-tasks
2. Executor handles individual sub-tasks
3. Results feed back to planner for re-planning if needed
4. Larger model for planning, smaller models for execution (cost optimization)

**Use Cases**:
- Building data pipelines (plan steps, execute each)
- Research projects (plan research strategy, execute searches)
- Software development (plan architecture, implement components)

**Performance**:
- **Cost**: Optimized (cheap models for execution)
- **Quality**: Better than direct execution
- **Latency**: Planning adds overhead

**Real-World Usage**:
- LangChain's plan-and-execute
- Used in complex workflows

**Note**: Aixgo already has `PlannerAgent` - this pattern integrates it with execution.

### 12. Nested/Composite Pattern

**Status**: 🔮 Future (v2.2+)

**Also Known As**: Sub-Agent Composition, Hierarchical Agents, Agent Trees

**Problem It Solves**:
Encapsulating complex multi-agent workflows within a single agent interface for reuse and modularity.

**When to Use**:
- Reusable agent components across workflows
- Complex sub-workflows as single agents
- Modular agent development
- Testing complex flows as units

**How It Works**:
1. Outer agent presents single interface
2. Internal sub-agents handle specific aspects
3. Results synthesized before returning
4. Callers unaware of internal complexity

**Use Cases**:
- **ResearchAgent**: Internally uses SearchAgent + SummarizerAgent + FactCheckerAgent
- **DataAnalysisAgent**: Internally uses LoaderAgent + CleanerAgent + AnalyzerAgent
- **ContentAgent**: Internally uses WriterAgent + EditorAgent + FormatterAgent

**Performance**:
- **Modularity**: High (reusable components)
- **Complexity**: High (nested orchestration)

**Real-World Usage**:
- Software engineering (composition principle)
- Limited AI agent adoption (emerging pattern)
