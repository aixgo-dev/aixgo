**Two releases ship today.** Both solve real problems Go developers face when building production AI agents.

- **v0.1.1**: Automatic validation retry cuts structured output failures 40-70%
- **v0.1.2**: Deterministic voting eliminates LLM costs for consensus decisions

Here's what changed and why it matters.

## Deterministic Aggregation: 8000× Faster, Zero Cost

Multi-agent systems need to combine outputs. Before v0.1.2, every aggregation required an LLM call—even for simple majority votes.

**The problem**: You're paying $0.01-0.03 and waiting 500-2000ms just to count which answer got the most votes.

**The fix**: Four new voting strategies that run in <1ms with zero API cost:

| Strategy            | Use Case                                              | Speed  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `voting_majority`   | Democratic consensus                                  | <0.1ms |
| `voting_unanimous`  | Safety-critical decisions (fails if any disagreement) | <0.1ms |
| `voting_weighted`   | Expert panels with confidence scores                  | <0.2ms |
| `voting_confidence` | Trust the most confident agent                        | <0.1ms |

```yaml
# Before: LLM call for every aggregation
agents:
  - name: aggregator
    role: aggregator
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    aggregator_config:
      aggregation_strategy: consensus

# After: Instant, free, deterministic
agents:
  - name: aggregator
    role: aggregator
    aggregator_config:
      aggregation_strategy: voting_majority
```

**When to use what:**

- **Deterministic** (4 strategies): Simple consensus, cost-sensitive pipelines, regulated industries needing audit trails
- **LLM-based** (5 strategies): Resolving conflicts, synthesizing nuanced viewpoints, creating narratives from conflicting inputs

You now have **9 total strategies**. Pick the right tool for the job.

## Validation Retry: 40-70% Fewer Failures

LLMs fail structured extraction constantly. GPT-4 omits required fields 30-40% of the time. Claude forgets email validation. Gemini returns strings where you need integers.

**The problem**: You're writing manual retry logic for every structured output call.

**The fix**: Aixgo automatically retries when validation fails—sending error details back to the LLM.

```go
type User struct {
    Name  string `json:"name" validate:"required"`
    Email string `json:"email" validate:"required,email"`
    Age   int    `json:"age" validate:"gte=0,lte=150"`
}

// That's it. Automatic retry on validation failure.
user, err := llm.CreateStructured[User](ctx, client, prompt, nil)
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**

1. LLM returns `{"name": "John", "age": 30}` (missing email)
2. Aixgo detects validation failure, sends error feedback to LLM
3. LLM corrects: `{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com", "age": 30}`
4. Your code receives valid data

**Results across production workloads:**

- Simple schemas (3-5 fields): 30% → 8% failure rate (**73% improvement**)
- Complex schemas (10+ fields): 45% → 18% failure rate (**60% improvement**)

Zero configuration required. Enabled by default.

## Security Hardening

All critical Aikido security issues fixed:

- **SSRF protection**: URL validation in SIEM integrations
- **Path traversal prevention**: Blocked directory traversal in file operations
- **Command injection fixes**: Sanitized kubectl commands
- **Kubernetes hardening**: Non-root users, dropped capabilities, read-only filesystems

```yaml
# Production-ready security context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65532
  capabilities:
    drop: [ALL]
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

## Documentation: 49% Smaller

We cut 1,782 lines of redundant documentation. Same information, half the reading.

## Upgrade

```bash
go get github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo@v0.1.2
```

**Breaking changes**: None. All existing configurations work unchanged.
