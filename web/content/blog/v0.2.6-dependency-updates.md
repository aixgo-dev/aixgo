We're pleased to announce **Aixgo v0.2.6**, a maintenance release focused on dependency updates and release automation. This release brings Aixgo up to date with the latest Google GenAI SDK and modernizes our CI/CD infrastructure.

## What's New

### 1. Google GenAI SDK Major Update

Updated `google.golang.org/genai` from v0.5.0 to **v1.40.0**, bringing significant improvements to the Vertex AI provider:

**Breaking API Changes**:

The GenAI SDK changed several pointer types to direct values for better type safety:

```go
// Before (v0.5.0)
response.UsageMetadata.PromptTokenCount    // *int32
response.UsageMetadata.CandidatesTokenCount // *int32

// After (v1.40.0)
response.UsageMetadata.PromptTokenCount    // int32
response.UsageMetadata.CandidatesTokenCount // int32
```

Aixgo's Vertex AI provider (`internal/llm/provider/vertexai.go`) has been updated to handle these changes seamlessly.

**New Capabilities**:

- **Thinking Levels**: Enhanced reasoning capabilities for Gemini models
- **Ephemeral Token Support**: Improved security for short-lived credentials
- **Multi-Speaker Support**: Better context handling for conversational AI

These features are now available to Aixgo applications using the Vertex AI provider with compatible Gemini models.

### 2. GitHub Actions Modernization

Our CI/CD workflows now use the latest Actions versions with Node.js 24 support:

- **golangci-lint-action**: v4 → v9 (improved linting performance and caching)
- **upload-artifact**: v5 → v6 (better retention policies and cross-workflow access)
- **download-artifact**: v3 → v12 (enhanced artifact management)

These updates improve build reliability and prepare our infrastructure for future GitHub Actions features.

### 3. Automated Binary Releases

Added `.goreleaser.yaml` for streamlined release automation using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/):

**Supported Platforms**:

```bash
# Operating Systems
- Linux (ELF binaries)
- macOS (Darwin)
- Windows (.exe binaries)

# Architectures
- amd64 (x86-64)
- arm64 (Apple Silicon, ARM servers)
```

**CLI Tools Included**:

- `orchestrator` - Multi-agent system orchestration
- `benchmark` - Performance benchmarking suite
- `deploy` - Deployment automation
- `tools` - Utility commands

**Binary Downloads**:

Starting with v0.2.6, you can download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/releases):

```bash
# Example: Download orchestrator for macOS ARM64
curl -LO https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/releases/download/v0.2.6/orchestrator_darwin_arm64
chmod +x orchestrator_darwin_arm64
./orchestrator_darwin_arm64 --help
```

### 4. Installation Documentation Clarity

Updated README with clearer installation paths for different use cases:

**For Library Users** (embed Aixgo in your application):

```bash
go get github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo@v0.2.6
```

**For CLI Tool Users** (use Aixgo commands):

```bash
# Option 1: Install via go install
go install github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/cmd/orchestrator@v0.2.6

# Option 2: Download pre-built binaries
# Visit: https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/releases/v0.2.6
```

**For Contributors** (develop Aixgo):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo.git
cd aixgo
make build
```

## Why This Release Matters

### Vertex AI Provider Improvements

The GenAI v1.40.0 update brings production-ready features that enhance Aixgo's Vertex AI integration:

1. **Thinking Levels**: Enable deeper reasoning for complex agent tasks
2. **Better Type Safety**: Direct value types reduce nil pointer errors
3. **Future-Proof**: Aligns with Google's long-term AI API design

If you're using the Vertex AI provider, this update provides immediate access to new Gemini capabilities without code changes.

### Release Automation Benefits

GoReleaser integration streamlines our release process:

- **Faster Releases**: Automated binary builds reduce release time from hours to minutes
- **Consistent Packaging**: All binaries follow the same naming and structure
- **Easy Distribution**: Users can choose between `go install` or pre-built binaries

### CI/CD Modernization

GitHub Actions updates improve developer experience:

- **Faster Builds**: Improved caching and parallel execution
- **Better Artifacts**: Enhanced artifact retention and cross-workflow sharing
- **Node.js 24**: Latest runtime for future Actions features

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to v0.2.6

**For Library Users**:

```bash
# Update your go.mod
go get -u github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo@v0.2.6

# Verify dependencies
go mod tidy
```

**For CLI Tool Users**:

```bash
# Reinstall tools
go install github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo/cmd/orchestrator@v0.2.6

# Or download new binaries from GitHub Releases
```

### Vertex AI Provider Changes

No code changes required. The provider automatically handles the GenAI SDK updates:

```yaml
# Your existing configuration works as-is
agents:
  - name: gemini-analyst
    role: react
    model: gemini-2.0-flash-001
    prompt: "Analyze the following data..."
    provider: vertexai
```

### Breaking Changes

**None**. This is a maintenance release with backward-compatible changes.

## What's Next

The v0.2.6 release sets the foundation for upcoming improvements:

- **Enhanced Vertex AI Features**: Leverage thinking levels and multi-speaker support
- **Automated Release Notes**: Generate changelogs from commits
- **Binary Checksums**: Add SHA256 verification for downloaded binaries
- **Homebrew Formula**: macOS package manager integration
