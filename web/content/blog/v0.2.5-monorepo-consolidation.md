We're excited to announce **Aixgo v0.2.5**, featuring a significant infrastructure improvement: the Aixgo website has been consolidated into the main repository as a monorepo. This change streamlines development and improves the contributor experience.

## What Changed

The Aixgo website source code, previously maintained in a separate `aixgo-dev/web` repository, now lives at `web/` in the main [aixgo-dev/aixgo](https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo) repository.

**Before**:
```bash
# Two separate repositories
github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo      # Framework code
github.com/aixgo-dev/web        # Website code
```

**After**:
```bash
# Single unified repository
github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo
├── agents/                     # Framework code
├── examples/
├── docs/
└── web/                        # Website code
    ├── content/
    ├── themes/
    └── static/
```

## Why Monorepo?

The consolidation delivers several key benefits:

### Single Source of Truth

Documentation and code now live together, making it easier to keep them in sync. When you update a feature, you can update the corresponding documentation in the same pull request.

### Simplified Contribution Workflow

Contributors no longer need to navigate between repositories. Want to improve an example and update the related guide? One repository, one PR.

```bash
# Before: Two repositories, two PRs
cd aixgo && git checkout -b feature-x
cd ../web && git checkout -b docs-feature-x

# After: One repository, one PR
cd aixgo && git checkout -b feature-x-with-docs
```

### Better Example Integration

Example READMEs now link directly to comprehensive web guides without cross-repository references. The documentation hierarchy is clearer and easier to navigate.

### Unified CI/CD

Build, test, and deployment workflows are consolidated. Website changes trigger automated builds and validation alongside framework tests.

## For Contributors

### Website Development

Developing the website locally is straightforward:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo.git
cd aixgo

# Start the development server
cd web && make dev

# Or from the root directory
make web-dev
```

### Available Make Targets

The root Makefile now includes website-specific targets:

```bash
make web-dev        # Start Hugo development server
make web-build      # Build production site
make web-lint       # Run markdownlint on content
make web-clean      # Clean generated files
```

### Documentation Updates

When adding or modifying features:

1. Update code in the main package directories
2. Update documentation in `docs/` or `web/content/` as needed
3. Submit a single PR with both changes

```bash
# Example workflow
git checkout -b add-new-pattern
# Edit internal/supervisor/patterns/new_pattern.go
# Edit web/content/guides/orchestration/new-pattern.md
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new orchestration pattern with documentation"
```

## Deployment

The website still deploys to Firebase Hosting via Cloud Build, but now triggers on changes to `web/**` in the main repository. The deployment pipeline remains unchanged:

- **Trigger**: Push to main branch with changes in `web/`
- **Build**: Cloud Build runs `hugo` to generate static site
- **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to [aixgo.dev](https://aixgo.dev)

## Migration Notes

### For External Contributors

If you had a fork of the old `web` repository:

1. Fork the main [aixgo-dev/aixgo](https://github.com/aixgo-dev/aixgo) repository
2. Website source is now in the `web/` directory
3. Create PRs against the main repository

### For Maintainers

The old `aixgo-dev/web` repository is now archived and read-only. All future website updates happen in the main repository.

## What's Next

The monorepo consolidation is the foundation for several upcoming improvements:

- **Enhanced Documentation Tooling**: Automated link validation and documentation coverage checks
- **Integrated Examples**: Live code examples embedded in documentation with automatic testing
- **Versioned Docs**: Documentation versioning tied to framework releases
