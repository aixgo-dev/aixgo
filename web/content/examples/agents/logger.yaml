# Logger Agent Configuration
# Simple logging agent that outputs messages to stdout/logs
# Use case: Debugging, monitoring, audit trails

agents:
  # Example 1: Basic logger with single input
  - name: basic-logger
    role: logger
    # Logger receives from one or more sources
    inputs:
      - source: data-producer

  # Example 2: Multi-input logger (aggregates from multiple sources)
  - name: aggregated-logger
    role: logger
    inputs:
      - source: agent-a
      - source: agent-b
      - source: agent-c

  # Example 3: Specialized audit logger
  - name: audit-logger
    role: logger
    inputs:
      - source: security-events
      - source: auth-events

# Supporting agents for the examples
  - name: data-producer
    role: producer
    interval: 2s
    outputs:
      - target: basic-logger

  - name: agent-a
    role: producer
    interval: 1s
    outputs:
      - target: aggregated-logger

  - name: agent-b
    role: producer
    interval: 1500ms
    outputs:
      - target: aggregated-logger

  - name: agent-c
    role: producer
    interval: 2s
    outputs:
      - target: aggregated-logger

  - name: security-events
    role: producer
    interval: 5s
    outputs:
      - target: audit-logger

  - name: auth-events
    role: producer
    interval: 3s
    outputs:
      - target: audit-logger

# Notes:
# - Logger outputs to stdout with [ALERT] prefix
# - Messages include type and payload
# - Useful for debugging agent pipelines
# - Can listen to multiple sources simultaneously
# - No configuration needed - works out of the box
# - Consider external log aggregation for production use
# - Logs are written immediately (no buffering)
