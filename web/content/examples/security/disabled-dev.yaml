# Security Configuration: Disabled (Development Only)
# WARNING: Never use this configuration in production!
# For local development and testing only.

environment: development
auth_mode: disabled

# No authentication required
# All requests are accepted without identity verification
# Use only on localhost or isolated development environments

authorization:
  enabled: false
  default_deny: false
  # No access control - all operations allowed

audit:
  enabled: false
  backend: memory
  log_auth_decisions: false
  # Minimal logging to reduce development noise

# Agent configuration with no security

# Use Cases:
# - Local development on laptop
# - Unit testing
# - Integration testing (isolated environment)
# - Prototyping and experimentation

# Security Warnings:
# 1. NEVER expose this configuration to the internet
# 2. NEVER use in production, staging, or any shared environment
# 3. NEVER commit API keys with this config
# 4. ONLY use on localhost or isolated networks

# How to Use Safely:
# 1. Run only on localhost (127.0.0.1)
# 2. Use firewall to block external access
# 3. Don't commit sensitive data to git
# 4. Switch to proper auth before deployment
# 5. Use environment-specific configs

# Migration to Production:
# Before deploying:
# 1. Change environment to "production"
# 2. Set auth_mode to "builtin", "delegated", or "hybrid"
# 3. Enable authorization with default_deny: true
# 4. Enable audit logging with appropriate backend
# 5. Test authentication and authorization thoroughly

# Notes:
# - This is the simplest configuration possible
# - Ideal for rapid development iteration
# - No overhead from auth checks
# - Fast startup and testing
# - Remember to switch to secure config before any deployment
